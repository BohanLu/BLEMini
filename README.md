BLEMini
=======

BLE Mini is a small, certified BLE development board for makers to do their innovative projects. It can be used for BLE development using TI CC254x SDK.

We also provide some examples to show how to integrate this board to other platform such as Arduino. It can also be run independently.


Dependency
==========

BLE Mini requires different firmwares to function, so it depends on some opensource projects:<br/>
- Biscuit
- MiniBeacon
- HCI

All are hosted at https://github.com/RedBearLab


Examples
========

Samples show how to connect iOS/Mac to your Arduino via BLE link. More interesting resource will be added soon.

SimpleControls
- This demo shows how to create controls for common Arduino pin settings
- Please refer to "Readme_SimpleControls.txt" for details

Chat
- A simple chat demo for iOS to talk to Arduino
- Please refer to "Readme_Chat.txt" for details

MiniBeacon
- Implemented Apple's iBeacon spec.
- Use our MiniBeacon iOS App to set the parameters.
